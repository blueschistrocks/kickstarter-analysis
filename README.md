# Kickstarter Crowdfunding Campaign Data Analysis
Crowdfunding campaigns data provided by Louise was analyzed via excel filters, pivot tables and statistical functions. Louise indicated initially that she is interested in an analysis of crowdfunding campaign date for United States (US) based theatrical productions focusing on the plays subcategory. 

## Crowdfunding Campaign Data Analysis Based on the Theatrical Category 

US campaign data was filtered by the parent category theatrical productions and further filtered by the subcategory of plays.  The funding outcomes of US crowdfunding campaigns in the theater parent category were filtered primarily by the success, failure or cancelation of their funding campaigns.  Based on a review of the data analysis a slight majority (approx. 58%) of the funding campaigns were successful in getting sufficient funding.  The data was graphed, and the chart labeled US Parent Category Outcomes is provided at this link for [Link](Outcomes-start-dates_US-theater_.png) for review. 

## Crowdfunding Campaign Data Analysis Based on the Funding Launch Date

Using pivot tables, the US crowdfunding campaign data for theatrical productions was filtered by the month crowdfunding was started. The data indicated that crowdfunding campaigns the lunched in the month of May were the most successful and those lunched in the months of December and January were the least successful. The filtered data was depicted graphically, and chart labeled Outcomes of US Theatrical Crowdfunding Campaigns Based on Launch Date provided for review.

## Statistical Analysis of US Crowdfunding Campaign Data

The statistical analysis of the data set for crowdfunding campaign goals indicates that successful campaigns tended to have a median goal of around $3,000. The median pledge amounts were around $3,000 as well. The mean goals of the successful campaigns was around $5,000, which was also the mean pledged.  The analysis also appears to indicate that successful and fail campaigns had some high outliers, with the failed campaigns having some very high outliers.  Based on the analysis setting a more moderate goal around $3,000 to $5,000 would have the best chance of success.
